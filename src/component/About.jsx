            I am a front-end developer based in Sydney looking for exciting
            opportunities. Has Mechanical Engineering background. Likes to focus
            on accessibility when developing. Passionate and curious about
            solving problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Webflow and a
            bit of Designing. While I am not programming, I enjoy playing
            football, photography and playing Valorant. Learning more to improve
            skill.
